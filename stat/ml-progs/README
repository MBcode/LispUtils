This directory contains Common Lisp files for various standard
inductive learning algorithms that all use the same basic data format
and same interface.  It also includes automatic testing software for
running learning curves that compare multiple systems and utilities
for plotting and statistically evaluating the results.

The file "data-utilities" should be loaded before any other code.
Comments at the begining of universal-tester.lisp help define the data
format and interface standards used.  Commenting elsewhere can be
sparse.

See comments in the universal-tester.lisp file and the trace in
sample-univ-tester-trace to see how to use the universal tester.

Sample data sets are dna-standard.lisp and labor-neg.lisp.  DATA-UTILITIES.LISP
includes a function for converting a data file suitable for Quinlan`s C4.5 to
the "ml-prog" format.

Current algorithms include versions of:

AQ:		Early DNF learner.
Backprop: 	The standard multi-layer neural-net learning method.
Bayes Indp:     Simple naive or "idiot's" Bayesian classifier.
Cobweb:   	A probabilistic clustering system.
ID3:            Decision tree learner with a number of features.
KNN:   		K nearest neighbor (instance-based) algorithm.
Perceptron:	Early one-layer neural-net algorithm.
PFOIL:          Propositional version of FOIL for learning DNF.
PFOIL-CNF:      Propositional version of FOIL for learning CNF.
Dlist:          Propositional decision-list learner using a FOIL-based approach
PFOIDL:         Propositional version of FOIDL for learning decision-lists
                in the reverse order.
PGOLEM:         Propositional version of GOLEM (ILP system) for learning DNF.
